[Original Read](https://blog.carloslab-ai.com/Articles/BehaviorAI/WhyUseUtilityAI)

When developing AI systems for games, selecting the right decision-making architecture is crucial. This study explores the advantages of Utility AI compared to Behavior Trees and Finite State Machines (FSMs). We will define each approach, highlight their key features, advantages, and use cases, and ultimately help you decide which one to use for your AI needs.

## Understanding Behavior Trees

### What are Behavior Trees?

Behavior Trees (BT) are hierarchical structures used to model complex behaviors in agents, particularly within artificial intelligence for video games and robotics. They organize actions and decisions into a tree format, making it easier to manage and visualize behaviors.

### Key Concepts of Behavior Trees:

1. **Nodes**: The building blocks of a BT, which include:
   - **Action Nodes**: Perform specific tasks (e.g., move, attack).
   - **Condition Nodes**: Assess specific conditions (e.g., is the enemy in range?).
   - **Composite Nodes**: Control the execution flow of child nodes (e.g., selector, sequence).

2. **Execution Flow**: The behavior tree is traversed starting from the root, with nodes executed based on their type and results.

### Advantages of Behavior Trees:

- **Flexibility**: Easily add or modify behaviors without disrupting existing logic.
- **Reusability**: Nodes can be reused across different behavior trees.
- **Simplicity**: The tree structure makes debugging and understanding AI behavior straightforward.
- **Dynamic Decision-Making**: Capable of adapting to changing game states.

### Simple Example of a Behavior Tree:

```
Root
└── Selector
    ├── Sequence
    │   ├── Condition (Is Enemy Nearby?)
    │   └── Action (Attack Enemy)
    └── Action (Patrol)
```
- **Explanation**: The guard checks if an enemy is nearby. If so, it attacks; otherwise, it patrols.

## Understanding Finite State Machines (FSM)

### What is a Finite State Machine?

A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a computational model that represents a system with a finite number of states and transitions between those states based on input. It is commonly used for defining the behavior of characters and systems in games.

### Key Components of FSM:

1. **States**: Defines different conditions or modes (e.g., "Idle," "Attacking").
2. **Transitions**: Rules for moving from one state to another based on events.
3. **Input**: External factors that trigger transitions (user actions, game events).

### Advantages of FSM:

- **Organized Logic**: Simplifies management of complex behaviors.
- **Clarity**: Provides a clear representation of states and transitions.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new states without huge disruptions.

### Example Use Cases of FSM:

1. **Character Behavior**:
   - States like "Patrolling," "Chasing," or "Attacking," with transitions based on player proximity.
  
2. **Game Menus**:
   - States such as "Main Menu" and "Gameplay," with transitions driven by user inputs.

3. **Game Level Progression**:
   - States like "Loading," "Playing," or "Game Over," with transitions triggered by game events.

## Understanding Utility Intelligence (UI)

### What is Utility Intelligence?

Utility Intelligence is a decision-making framework that allows characters to choose actions based on multiple criteria. Rather than following fixed rules, characters evaluate various actions to determine which one maximizes their "utility" based on the current game state.

### Key Concepts of Utility Intelligence:

1. **Utility Function**: Assigns values to actions based on desirability. Higher values indicate more favorable actions.
   
2. **Multi-Criteria Decision Making**: Characters assess various factors (health, enemy distance) when making decisions.
   
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Agents adjust their choices based on the changing game environment.

4. **Action Selection**: The action with the highest utility value is chosen.

### Example of Utility Intelligence in Practice:

Imagine an AI character in a survival game deciding between the actions "Attack Enemy," "Seek Cover," "Heal," and "Collect Resources." Based on the current state (e.g., low health), the character calculates utility values for each action and acts accordingly.

### Advantages of Utility Intelligence:

- **Flexibility**: Accommodates multiple variables for complex interactions.
- **Human-like Behavior**: Agents exhibit more realistic, adaptive decision-making.
- **Modularity**: Easy to extend or modify without significant overhaul.

## Comparing Behavior Trees, Finite State Machines, and Utility Intelligence

### Use Cases:
- **Behavior Trees**: Best for structured, hierarchical decisions and when reusability is key.
- **Finite State Machines**: Ideal for simple, predictable behaviors with well-defined states.
- **Utility Intelligence**: Best for nuanced and context-aware decision-making.

### Design Complexity:
- **Behavior Trees**: Easier to design and visualize.
- **FSMs**: Simple to implement but can become complex as states increase.
- **Utility Systems**: More complex due to mathematical calculations.

### Flexibility:
- **Utility Systems**: More adaptable to environmental changes.
- **Behavior Trees**: More rigid but organized.
- **FSMs**: Fixed states with limited flexibility.

## Conclusion

Choosing between Behavior Trees, Finite State Machines, and Utility Intelligence depends on the specific needs of your game and its AI agents. 

- **Use Behavior Trees** for clear, manageable structures that emphasize reusability.
- **Use Finite State Machines** for predictable, state-driven behaviors.
- **Use Utility Intelligence** for dynamic and responsive decision-making.

In many cases, developers combine these approaches to create a hybrid system, leveraging the strengths of each to cater to the unique requirements of their game.
